# Laravel ClickSend Notification Channel

## For submission to Laravel 

This code is based on the Laravel Vonage Notification Channel. 

Most files mirror that of the Vonage code. There are difference to available authentication methods. 
And ClickSend does not offer a callback for hooks in the sms send. Otherwise, all the methods should work as
the Vonage counter-part.

I wrote this for submission to Laravel. I am happy for it to live at laravel. 
Go easy on me, it's my first package and first submission. 
I'm happy to make any required changes or rewrites.
